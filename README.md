# my_vimrc

My vimrc on Ubuntu. 

I hope this repository can help me manage the file better.

Also, I want to learn more about VIM. I think it is a very powerful
EDITOR that is greater than a great number of IDEs.

But First, I should learn how to deal with these great number of settings
and plugins.
